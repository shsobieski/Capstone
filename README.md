# Faultlines

## Goal
As American political opinion seems to get more and more bifricated, I intend to analyze this trend using machine learning techniques to predict voting patterns of Americans going into the 2020 Presendential election. Can we use attitudes, lifestyle, and other factors to determine what kind of people are most likely to vote, and for who? 

## Purpose
As a political analyst, I will plot trends in political opinion to get an understanding of how Americans feel about particular issues. Using time series analysis I will attempt to predict where these trends are heading. I will repeat this analysis for several questions, and break the data down into political groupings such as voters and non-voters, or Republicans, Democrats and Independents.  

Using this time series analysis in conjunction with some overall American characteristics such as GDP I will attempt to model America based on the attitudes held by it's populous.

Next I will use the political opinion data to cluster American opinion into an appropriate number of groups. By visualising this I will be able to show how American opinion has consolidated or divided on particular issues and what the two-party system is missing.

Finally, I will compare this data to political speeches throughout the timespan of the study. Using this information I will assess whether speeches by the winners and losers of those elections were speaking to the issues most relevant to voters at the time.
